# Comment Length Validation Fix

## Issue
"422 (Unprocessable Content)" error when users try to submit comments with large amounts of text.

## Root Cause
Comments have a server-side validation limit of 1000 characters, but there was no client-side validation or user feedback to prevent users from submitting overly long comments.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Validation
Added pre-submission validation to prevent 422 errors:

**UserPost.jsx**:
- Added length check before submitting new comments
- Added length check before submitting comment edits
- Both functions now show appropriate error messages

**AdminComments.jsx**:
- Added length check in admin comment editing
- Shows character count in error message for clarity

### 2. User Experience Improvements

**Character Counter**:
- Added real-time character counter for new comments (X/1000 characters)
- Added real-time character counter for comment editing
- Counter turns red when limit is exceeded

**Form Enhancements**:
- Added `maxLength={1000}` attribute to input fields
- Submit buttons are disabled when text exceeds limit
- Clear visual feedback for character limit status

**Better Error Messages**:
- Client-side: "Comment cannot exceed 1000 characters"
- Admin side: Shows exact character count when limit exceeded

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Before**: 
```javascript
// No validation - would cause 422 error
body: JSON.stringify({ content: commentContent })
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Client-side validation first
if (commentContent.length > 1000) {
  setCommentError('Comment cannot exceed 1000 characters.');
  setCommentLoading(false);
  return;
}
// Then submit if valid
body: JSON.stringify({ content: commentContent })
```

## Files Modified
- `resources/js/pages/UserPost.jsx` - Added validation and character counters
- `resources/js/pages/AdminComments.jsx` - Added validation for admin editing

## Benefits
1. **Prevents 422 errors** - Users can't submit invalid comments
2. **Better UX** - Real-time feedback shows character count
3. **Clear limits** - Users know exactly how much they can type
4. **Consistent validation** - Both user and admin sides have same limits
5. **Graceful degradation** - Server-side validation still exists as backup

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Go to any blog post
2. Try typing a comment longer than 1000 characters
3. Notice the character counter and disabled submit button
4. Try editing an existing comment with >1000 characters
5. Verify that validation prevents submission and shows helpful messages

The 422 error should no longer occur for comment length issues, and users will have clear feedback about the character limit.
