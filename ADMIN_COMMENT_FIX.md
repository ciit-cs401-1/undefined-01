# Admin Comment Edit Fix

## Issue
"Failed to update edit comment on the admin side" - Admin users were unable to edit comments through the admin interface.

## Root Cause
The admin comment editing functionality had authentication mismatches:

1. **Authentication Type Mismatch**: Admin comment editing was trying to use Bearer token authentication, but the comment API routes expect session-based authentication.

2. **Missing CSRF Token**: The admin side wasn't fetching and including the CSRF token required for Laravel Sanctum session authentication.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated AdminComments.jsx
- **Changed authentication method**: Removed Bearer token approach
- **Added CSRF token handling**: Now fetches `/sanctum/csrf-cookie` and includes `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and response handling
- **Updated both edit and delete functions** to use consistent authentication

### 2. Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Old (incorrect) approach:
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

// New (correct) approach:
await fetch('/sanctum/csrf-cookie', { credentials: 'include' });
const xsrfToken = // extract from cookie
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'X-XSRF-TOKEN': xsrfToken,
}
```

## Files Modified
- `resources/js/pages/AdminComments.jsx` - Fixed authentication and CSRF handling

## How It Works Now
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/comments`
2. Admin clicks "Edit" on a comment
3. System fetches CSRF cookie from Laravel Sanctum
4. System extracts XSRF-TOKEN from cookie
5. System sends PATCH request with proper CSRF token
6. Laravel validates session and CSRF token
7. Comment is updated successfully

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Manage Comments
3. Click "Edit" on any comment
4. Modify the content and save
5. Comment should update successfully

## Why This Approach
- Consistent with existing user-side comment editing
- Follows Laravel Sanctum best practices for session authentication
- Maintains security through CSRF protection
- Compatible with existing middleware setup
