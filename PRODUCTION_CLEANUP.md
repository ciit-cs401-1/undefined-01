## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production .env
   # Edit .env with your production values
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   deploy-production.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./deploy-production.sh
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Tasks**:
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up domain DNS
   - Configure backup strategies
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure mail settings

The application is now ready for production deployment with all debug and development files cleaned up.
